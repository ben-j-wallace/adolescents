For many American children, schools occupy an essential niche in their lives. As individuals age, the influence of parents and other caretakers decreases, and they interact more with peers, teachers, and other adults in their communities (Aldana & Byrd 2015; Bradshaw 2014). Consequently, schools help facilitate adolescents' formations of core identities and beliefs. Historically, analysts have explored these developments with Black students' educational experiences, such as their academic placement, relationships with teachers, and discipline, influence their identities, educational performance, and life outcomes (Ba√±ales et. al 2020; Francis & Darity 2021; Pena-Shaff et. al 2019; Brown 2007; Hughes 2009). Other studies extend these issues to Latino, Asian American, and multi-racial individuals (see, e.g., Brega & Coleman, 1999; Phinney & Chavira, 1995; Stone 2017). However, white American students remain largely absent from these inquiries due to the seemingly invisible and white-centering logic of colorblind ideology, which posits that race does not matter, all people are equal, and that racism is a relic of the past (Bonilla-Silva 2018). Because of their dominant position in the United States's contemporary racial order, white individuals enjoy the material advantages and "psychological wages" of whiteness and tend to ascribe to ideological frameworks minimizing the role of race and racism (cite Dubois). However, few studies explore how white children share, reproduce, and rework these ideas in the context of schools. This paper specifically focuses on how white adolescents interact with curricula, teachers, and peers to absorb, contest, and rework colorblind ideology in school contexts. By drawing upon previous scholarship documenting white adolescents' perceptions in survey data, interviews, and ethnographic observations, analysts can understand the content of their narratives about racial identity, racism, and oppression.

Studies on the acquisition of racial ideologies often recruit parents to report their children's racial practices (e.g. interracial friendships, standing up to racism, etc.) and discuss the content of family conversations about racism (Onyekwuluje 2000; Hagerman 2017). Shifting the focus of this scholarship from parent's to children's perceptions can illuminate aspects of children's behaviors and beliefs that are often obstructed from their parents' view. Students' experiences in schools are one such example. **analysts using child-centered methods can more easily develop existing theories about the reproduction of dominant racial ideologies and inform anti-racist teaching strategies and school policies** (Rogers 2021).

Since individuals' understandings of race evolves with age, I narrow the scope of this article to white adolescents' perceptions of these matters. Throughout their lives, white individuals interact with the *white habitus*, a "racialized process of socialization" through which they develop beliefs, perceptions, tastes, and behaviors (Bonilla-Silva 2018, 73). The strength of the white habitus persists despite historical efforts towards racial integration as many white people continue to grow up in white neighborhoods, social networks, and schools. The socializing and racializing work of such environments, for example, helps explain how children develop a sense of racial identity at very young ages and prefer peers or toys based on race (Clark & Clark 1947; **find more recent examples**). By adolescence, these racial identities and beliefs crystallize and differentiate from the adults around them. One's teenage years, in short, are critical to identity formation and the construction of ideological attachments. 

To be sure, schools provide a limited view into the lives of adolescents. Past analyses have revealed the unique niches of parents, the media, and neighborhoods that are not easily separable from each other (Vitrup 2011). Likewise, studying adolescence alone ignores earlier life experiences that shape individuals' views and sense of self. As such, policies and practices intended to disrupt colorblindness must also target earlier stages of development (Hagerman 2020). Finally, since white individuals are socialized differently, conclusions from studies recruiting adolescents and their perceptions of schools cannot be generalized to white teenagers overall; factors like geographic region, class, and gender also shape perceptions and beliefs about race and racism (Grossman 2009; Ghavami & Mistry 2019). Despite these limitations, the material conditions produced by whiteness cannot be discounted; its allocation of privileges and resources in schools ultimately shapes narratives about race that many white adolescents share.

This paper begins with a review of racial and ethnic socialization, particularly among white adolescents, and directs it towards a discussion of how schools exist as race-making and socializing institutions. I then introduce informal and formal components of public high schools and use meta-analysis to produce conclusions [after this part is written, I can include my conclusions here].

## Background

Race is a social construct that has shifted throughout the United States' unique history of racial oppression. While population geneticists contend that human variation does not satisfy discrete biological "races," race remains socially real (Royal ___). Racialized practices and social relations continue to shape Americans' life outcomes across areas of housing, wealth accumulation, health, and education. Significant associations between race and educational outcomes, for example, cannot be understood as reflecting racial groups' inherent characteristics. Instead, the "main effect" of race, as well as other racialized measures, are sensitive to the racialized structure of American schools. 

Children demonstrate an understanding of race before their school years. As early as age ___, individuals can categorize both their own and others' physical appearances into races (Spencer 2008). By middle childhood, these observations obtain stronger subjective relevance. In the contemporary United States, primary school-aged children shift from explicit 

Finally, adolescents crystallize these racial identities and use ideological frames to make sense of matters like racism, diversity, and racial privilege ().

### Racial Learning

Identity formation is one aspect of race acquired by children and refined through development. The process of racial and ethnic socialization (RES) defines the totality of interactions individuals have with racial messages and . Originally, RES studies sought to understand how Black children made sense of messages of racial pride, racial barriers, cultural socialization, and promotion of mistrust (Barr & Neville 2008; include others).

Until recently, RES studies have overlooked white children, despite the fact that they are also individuals that acquire sense of racial identity, form racial attitudes, and most importantly, develop ideological positions based on their position in the racial order. The field of whiteness also examines children to uncover ...
