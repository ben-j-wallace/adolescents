## Intro

### Paragraph 1: Intro, link schooling to perceiving race

* Children, schooling important socialization
  * Beyond academic, identity formation and ideology
* Past studies focused Black children/adolescents
  * More recently, Latino/Asian/multi-racial
* Largely absent inquiry of white students
* Research question

### Paragraph 2: Why?

* Adolescence critical period
* Whites are socialized in a white habitus
  * Define white habitus
* Therefore, study of the adolescent perceptions reveal
  * crystallizing ideological commitments
  * as well as identity formation

### Paragraph 3: Limitations, role of school in adolescence

* Schools just one context
  * but its also an important one, cite examples
  * Within, students interact with curriculum, policies, peers, teachers, school staff, etc.
* Likewise, adolescence only one period
* hard to determine which factors contribute to perceptions
* whites experience socialization not same (link lewis)
  * but racial structure allows similiarities/benefits

## Race, Identity, and Racial Learning in Adolescence

#### Race

* Although race as it is biologically defined today does not apply to modern humans, analysts have repeatedly race is socially real, the ways in which people understand themselves, view others, and believe the world works is heavily racialized.
  * Moreover, race is a dynamic construct that has shifted meaning, stereotypes, etc. over time.
  * The "effects of race" are  not therefore not inherent to someone who is considered a member of a certain race, but rather constructed through the totality of relations and practices that make up a racial structure.
* Children begin to understand the significance of race through these "social encounters" (Spencer 2008 "Lessons learned and opportunities ignoredâ€¦") at various junctures in their development.
  * Moments of realizing race.
  * Gains subjective relevance in middle childhood

* One's own race is comprehended in formation of identity
  * Social development and identity
* These crystallize by adolescence
  * Include examples

#### Racial Learning

* Identity formation is one form of racial learning alongside the acquisition of racial beliefs.
* Define racial learning
* Define racial and ethnic socialization (RES) **focus on differences** (is racial learning a part of RES but just doesn't include instinctive?)
* Originally studied with Black individuals
* What previous scholars argue about white individuals and RES
  * Particularly important in adolescence


#### Schools as places of Racial Learning/RES

* Scholarship on socialization contends that the role of parents, while still important, diminishes throughout adolescence as other agents like peer forces, the media, and ___ grow in salience.

* In following sections, review the influence of peers,

### Curricula

* At the writing of this article, American political discourse has taken aim at the education of race, racism, and _.
  * Even during Judge Ketanji Brown-Jackson's confirmation hearing to the United States Supreme Court, Senators have brought it up as an issue.
* However, even before the teaching of experiences of race were consumed by this recent culture war (fair analysis?), educators and policymakers have differed on whether and how the experiences and history of racial and ethnic groups should be discussed in schools.
  *

* Context: Current moment in the United States and teaching issues of race
  * In 36 states (as of Feb 2022), legislators have moved to [Source](https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism)
* Define curriculum: what is taught.
* Afrocentric education, multicultural
  * Anti-bias: stemming from efforts that saw that young children have racial preferences.

* Do white adolescents notice how their education marginalizes other world views?

### Teachers

* While curriculum is what is taught in classrooms, how teachers instruct their students, or pedagogy, is also important.
  *
* K-12 teachers are overwhelmingly white (Festritzer 2011 "Profile of Teachers in the United States" edweek. org) and middle-class yet many teach students from other racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
* Outside of the mandated curriculum, teachers also interact with their students informally, providing emotional assistance and connections.
  * Black students, same-race effect and support.
* How do white adolescents' experiences with teachers shape their understanding of race, racism, and inequality.

### Curricula

Educational legislation and school policies profoundly shape the environments in which children learn and live.

* Over the past few decades, the United States has slowly reverted back to a segregated school system that is evident through racialized metrics like standardized test results, drop-out rates, and income.
  * Statistic about schools racial demographics.
* Previous studies show that starting in middle school, adolescents broadly recognize the role of governmental institutions on public education, even if not to a detailed degree (e.g. "the system"). [Make sure this is historically linked, current]
  * For example, the experiences of
  * School trust higher among white students than Black, Latinx

*


While the effects of these policies are drastic and some analysts have considered their perceptions by Black and Latinx students, white students' perceptions of safety, crime, and __ are often overlooked.

* Many parents fear their child's safety, overall adult population.

* How is racialized? What do students think about issues of safety, and how do these policies impact these perceptions?

**how do white adolescents interpret their the racial context of high school (primarily public)?**

## Introduction

In the __ years since the landmark Supreme Court case *Brown v. Board of Education*, the United States has slowly reverted back to a system of segregated schooling.

* Include statistics, as well as citations of studies that discuss this phenomenon and the extent to which this is true.

The shift back towards a "color-neutral" school assignment policy towards neighborhood specific ones can be attributed to a number of forces, from legislation to , and to the topic of this study: white parents.

- Many of these agents, despite their multitude and complexities, however, adhere to the post-Civil Rights era racial ideology of color-evasive racism (include note of how it was called "color-blind racism" initially, but I will call it color-evasive for the paper for x reasons), which attempts to "racial inequality as the outcome of racial dynamics." In the case of white parents, analysts have discussed how white parents have resisted legislation and policies that would redistribute schooling resources.

However, more recently their arguments against these policies have adopted non-racial language and other subtleties that disguise efforts to reproduce advantages for white children.  

* Language like "good" versus "bad" schools and "well-behaved and intelligent" children versus "lazy and disruptive" ones have become many white parents' racial grammar that simultaneously allows them to reproduce educational advantages for their children without running the risk of appearing "racist."
* These parents, acutely aware of the racial order that frowns upon overt racism, are thus not likely to think that their ideology is being transmitted to their children.

Question: In this article, I ask how white adolescents perceive racialized contexts surrounding public school choices and outline how these efforts can be studied.

* These include non-verbal contexts [**what is the language on this?**] as well as verbal ones. Ex: Bader's (2019) "Talk on the playground"
* Why does this matter? Early empirical evidence (Hagerman 2020) suggests that young people's views on race crystallize throughout their adolescence and that peers, teachers, and school policies impact the racial views of high school-aged students.
  * As opposed to parents in early and middle childhood where parents taking a leading role.

* This paper does no argue that the racial and ethnic socialization (RES) of white adolescents occurs the same for each individual. Previous studies have shown (Grossman 2009) that the white adolescents' views on race vary vastly, from color-conscious claims through diversity ideology to color-evasive ones.
  * But color-evasive ideology is the dominant one (cite Bonilla-Silva)
  * Other demographic variation, such as their parents' degree of education, neighborhoods, socioeconomic status, and region also play a roles.

* A second point about this paper is that it does not simply discuss the white adolescents' *racial attitudes*, such as their feelings about people of color or other measures of racial resentment, but *racial* *ideology*, the "collective manifested" understandings of race that can either reinforce (dominant racial groups) and contest (subordinate racial groups) racial order.

**Map paragraph:**

In this article, I begin with a brief review of racial and ethnic socialization during whites' adolescence. I then analyze existing literature about to discuss how  white adolescents' perceptions of their schools can influence the development of their racial ideologies. The paper concludes by ___

For ==many white parents, the place that they send their children to school is a very serious matter, determining the .==

## Racial and Ethnic Socialization and Racial Ideology

Define both terms and why they are connected.

Early explorations of racial socialization focused primarily on Black children and the ways by which parents prepared them to construct a positive self-identity and face experiences of discrimination and prejudice (list the other ones after reviewing literature).

Whiteness studies

* Even though most white people do not think of themselves as 'raced' people, they are still racialized subjects. Whites are also racialized subjects by virtue of receiving a disproportionate amount of resources in our society
* This means that they are acclimated to the racialized social structure through their interpretations of the actions and words of various forces, such as the media, teachers (Picower 2009), their peers, and their parents.
* Early childhood ethnic socialization.

### Adolescents

As early as ___ age, children develop attitudes and perceptions of race (Gaither and Loyd 2018).

* However, adolescents have more complicated and easily-interpretable ideas about race and racism that solidify throughout teenage and early twenties (cite Hagerman). Thus, it is easier to analyze their racial ideology and understand the transition between childhood and adulthood.
