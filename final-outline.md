Outline:

## Intro

### Paragraph 1: Intro, link schooling to perceiving race

* Children, schooling important socialization
  * Beyond academic, identity formation and ideology
* Past studies focused Black children/adolescents
  * More recently, Latino/Asian/multi-racial
* Largely absent inquiry of white students
* Research question

### Paragraph 2: Why?

* Adolescence critical period
* Whites are socialized in a white habitus
  * Define white habitus
* Therefore, study of the adolescent perceptions reveal
  * crystallizing ideological commitments
  * as well as identity formation

### Paragraph 3: Limitations, role of school in adolescence

* Schools just one context
  * but its also an important one, cite examples
  * Within, students interact with curriculum, policies, peers, teachers, school staff, etc.
* Likewise, adolescence only one period
* hard to determine which factors contribute to perceptions
* whites experience socialization not same (link lewis)
  * but racial structure allows similiarities/benefits

## Race, Identity, and Racial Learning in Adolescence

#### Race

* Although race as it is biologically defined today does not apply to modern humans, analysts have repeatedly race is socially real, the ways in which people understand themselves, view others, and believe the world works is heavily racialized.
  * Moreover, race is a dynamic construct that has shifted meaning, stereotypes, etc. over time.
  * The "effects of race" are  not therefore not inherent to someone who is considered a member of a certain race, but rather constructed through the totality of relations and practices that make up a racial structure.
* Children begin to understand the significance of race through these "social encounters" (Spencer 2008 "Lessons learned and opportunities ignored…") at various junctures in their development.
  * Moments of realizing race.
  * Gains subjective relevance in middle childhood

* One's own race is comprehended in formation of identity
  * Social development and identity
* These crystallize by adolescence
  * Include examples

#### Racial Learning

* Identity formation is one form of racial learning alongside the acquisition of racial beliefs.
* Define racial learning
* Define racial and ethnic socialization (RES) **focus on differences** (is racial learning a part of RES but just doesn't include instinctive?)
* Originally studied with Black individuals
* What previous scholars argue about white individuals and RES
  * Particularly important in adolescence

#### Colorblindness

* Psychological discoveries: colorblind racism mostly negative. Decreases sensitivity to racism and discrimination (May 14, 2018)
  * Include ethnographic example (e.g. smiling discrimination)
* 


#### Schools as places of Racial Learning/RES

* Scholarship on socialization contends that the role of parents, while still important, diminishes throughout adolescence as other agents like peer forces, the media, and ___ grow in salience.

* In following sections, review the influence of peers,

### Curricula

* At the writing of this article, American political discourse has taken aim at the education of race, racism, and _.
  * This debate permeates across almost all levels of government, from school board to city council meetings, state legislature sessions, and even in Congress. 
  * during Judge Ketanji Brown-Jackson's confirmation hearing to the United States Supreme Court, Senators have brought it up as an issue.
* Despite their salience today, race, racial inequality, and racism have always mattered in the school curricula, whether mentioned explicitly or not (Thomas 2015; …)
* The term "curriculum" refers to what is learned, or the prescribed content for students in a given period of education.
* By nature of curricula being socially constructed, much like race, it exists in a hegemonic relationship with the culture which produces it.

  * For example, in French primary schools, lunch time is part of the mandated curriculum. Kids taught manners, expand their palette, nutrition. 
* Ultimately, notions of etiquette and proper nutrition are decided through "common sense"
* Similarly, the education of race is decided collectively, still 
  
  * Diversity ideology: Celebrating difference but ignoring the role of power, white supremacy, and white privilege in past and contemporary life. (multicultural approach, anti-bias as well)
  * The third most prominent, anti-racist (what conservative activists have recently put into their crosshairs). Makes the bulk of literature advocating for changes in curricula and teacher training.
* Context: Current moment in the United States and teaching issues of race (include above)
  * In 36 states (as of Feb 2022), legislators have moved to [Source](https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism)
* Even among social-justice oriented curricula, students' preconceived notions of racial and economic privilege can undermine these lessons.
  * Swalwell 2013, 5: Learning about injustice to pass down the knowledge, "help motivate people" reinforces cultural racism. Also resigned, benevolent benefactor, 
* As localities pursue different approaches to the teaching of race and racism, a central question is how white adolescents interpret them, particularly the extent to which they absorb or rework colorblind messages.
* Literary texts, especially those that include the stories of people of color, can give white adolescents a glimpse into the reality of being a person of color (Hatchell 2004)
  * By interacting with text in class discussions, white students can identity with those from other racial groups while still learning about the unique marginalization they face. e.g. Hatchell's interviewee relating to the experience of a 
  * Gospel of Wealth (Swalwell 2013) and interpretations about privilege.
* History
  * Hatchell (2004, 100): Omission of how early Aboriginals organized their societies at the time of European colonization in Australian history leads white students to "accept prevalent discourse" that dismisses Indigenous claims to land.



### Teachers

See Pollock 2004 from Thomas "We Always Talk About Race"

Teachers play a large role in shaping how issues of race, racism are taught in schools.

* Remains a predominately white profession.
  * Since 1987, the percentage of white American public school children has dropped from 71 percent to 47 percent. The percentage of white teachers, however, has decreased from 87 percent to 79 percent. (gap has doubled 16 vs. 32) (pew research 2018) 
* Approximately 70% of teachers (71% of white, 69% of Black, 68% Hispanic) adopt a color-mute frame (Vitrup 2016; Hazelbaker & Mistry 2021).

* Formally, these decisions influence how they frame the importance of racism within certain topics, for example: history. 
* Informally, they leverage expectations of their students that can be absorbed.
* Both the formal and informal mechanisms reflect ideological positions (e.g. colorblind racism, diversity ideology, etc.) that white adolesecents can contest, share, and reflect.

In teaching history, teachers decide which stories to augment and which to minimize.



* Hagerman: Racism is not a problem anymore. . . . Racism was a problem when all those slaves were around and that like bus thing. . . . And like Eleanor Roosevelt, and how she went on the bus. And she was African American and sat on the white part . . . but after the 1920s and all that, things change



Outside of history… teachers interact with their students differentially. 

* The large body of research on teacher expectancy of their students have revealed their tangible and racialized impacts on students' academic achievements, such as test scores (Sorhagan 2013), greater school discipline (Soumah and Hoover 2013), and graduation rates (cite).
* The process of how teacher expectancy is developed can be traced to Brophy and Good's (1970) model.
  * First, that teachers developing expectations based on classroom performance (manners, grades, test scores)
  * Teachers grouping students during instruction, thus differentating behaviors towards them.
  * Student's self concept, **define**, thus altered by their treatment from teachers.
  * Once made continuous, students alter their behaviors based on their.
* As early as _, students can recognize differences in treatment. Recent scholarship has tied the feedback loop of these processes to various outcomes. Include example of age  to age ___.

Since the Brophy and Good model, analysts have observed the racialized dimension of teacher expectancy and their impacts on the student's perceptions of worth.

* Fox (2016): Black students and other students of color (?) are more likely to receive favorable expectations for postsecondary attainment and recommendations for advanced courses from Black teachers.

  * Redding: expectancy of post-high school: Black teachers and Black children (11 points), Latinx teacher and Latinx student (13 points)

    Fox: Expectancy of post-high school: Black teacher and Black children (11 to 17 points)

    * There is little statistical evidence that white students benefit from a same-race teacher pairing.

* Past studies have confirmed that many adolescent of color are aware of negative treatment from teachers (Soumah & Hoover 2013),

* but it has been considerably less studied whether white adolescents perceive differential treatment and expectations from teachers. How their developing ideological commitments reflect contest these narratives.

Andrews & Gutwein: all racial groups can perceive differential treatment based on race and class.

* All could also perceive which students were framed as intellectually inferior, teachers construction of "good" and "respectful" students.

* White students interviewed however, did not always acknowledge the subtly of how teachers racialized "respectful" and "good" students.
  * One, for instance, mentioned discussed his teacher's preferential treatment to him based on his race.
  * I actually do feel as if I’m treated with an advantage, because I’m clearly active in the school, I’m on the news often, and I’m president of clubs and such ... so teachers tend to, like, not care as much about what I do... there was this really strict rule about drinks and you couldn’t have drinks and they were really enforcing it, and I clearly walked down the hall with a drink in my hand, and he [a teacher] just walked past me and he looked at me and we exchanged a nod.
  * The positive, uncritical treatment that the white male student received from his teachers reflects the benefit of his whiteness that Black and Latinx students in the school quickly. However, he is able to attribute his, naturalization frame

* Student: I think there are certain students who are really disrespectful, and I think that’s why a lot of teachers will, uh, almost establish sort of a discriminatory view on a certain type of student. Like you were saying of that certain racial group. 

  Interviewer: What certain racial group? 

  Student: Latinos and African Americans. I mean I hate to say it but it’s truly like it’s been established. I remember being in a class. A Latino kid simply asked to go to the bathroom, and my teacher, like, berated them about going to the bathroom. A middle school Black student described a similar idea. I don’t think they racist or anything, but I think that they expect the, like, if they did see something in the past from a Black person then they expect that second Black person to do the same thing

  * Acknowledges that teachers interact with Black students in a way that reinforces their previous notions of those students. 
  * Style of colorblindness, of not declaring negative treatment of others as racist.

Others



* What role do teachers 

Their relationship with students outside of formal instruction also matters.

* Students who internalize negative expectations tend to believe that their school efforts have little effect on their achievement (Johnston et al. 2020)



* While curriculum entails what is taught in classrooms, how teachers then instruct their students, or pedagogy, is also important.
* The teaching methods adopted by K-12 teachers on matters of race, racism, and diversity are especially

are overwhelmingly white (Festritzer 2011 "Profile of Teachers in the United States" edweek. org) and middle-class yet many teach students from other racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
* Outside of the mandated curriculum, teachers also interact with their students informally, and help satisfy their needs for belonging, competence, and autonomy (Bottani et al. 2016; see other citations there).
* emotional assistance and connections.
  * Black students, same-race effect and support.
* How do white adolescents' experiences with teachers shape their understanding of race, racism, and inequality.

Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to his White Mother Dangerous Minds (Thomas 2015). Both school mandated. 

*  Color of Water: white student opposes (161), so teacher says "It's a different kind of spin." Assumes SES of students, eventually students pick Hemingway's *A Farewell to Arms*.
* Dangerous Minds: N word debate, who can say it? How does a White teacher respond to student's observation? (166). "Some grown ups" kid qualifies the white teacher's statement that some people can use the n-word. Uses the NAACP as evidence that all Black people want the word to go away, that even Black people can't use it.

### Curricula

Educational legislation and school policies profoundly shape the environments in which children learn and live.

* Over the past few decades, the United States has slowly reverted back to a segregated school system that is evident through racialized metrics like standardized test results, drop-out rates, and income.
  * Statistic about schools racial demographics.
* Previous studies show that starting in middle school, adolescents broadly recognize the role of governmental institutions on public education, even if not to a detailed degree (e.g. "the system"). [Make sure this is historically linked, current]
  * For example, the experiences of
  * School trust higher among white students than Black, Latinx

* 

### Peers

Middle and high schools present tend to put more American students in contact with peers that share different identities (e.g. class, race, gender, sexual orientation). However, it has been observed that white adolescents mostly pursue friendships with individuals that are also white (see Aldana & Byrd citations).

* Moderated by "positive intergroup contact attitudes" (Rivas-Drake et al. 2018)
* Scholarship examining "self-segregation" often ignores the power imbalances that exist among adolescent peer networks.
  * White students tend to have only white friends, and students from marginalized racial groups are more likely to have friends *of all racial groups*. 

"Shutting down" when race is mentioned yet using the term "racist" pejoratively or humorously, which their parents don't do. Such as jokes about deciding who has black and white chess pieces (Hagerman 2016, 64)

* Hagerman: For instance, Britney (age 11), otherwise chatty and open with me, shuts down when I ask her to talk about race: Interviewer: Do you ever hear kids at your school—or do you and your friends ever talk about race? Britney: No. [Very quickly] Interviewer: Can you think of any times where you heard other kids like talking about race? Britney: [Shakes head no] Interviewer: Or making comments that you thought are not very nice about people of different races? Britney: No. [Avoids eye contact] Interviewer: So you never talk about race at school or with friends? Britney: No. [Shifting in seat] Interviewer: Why do you think that is? Britney: It’s not right. Interviewer: So outside of your school, do you think that racism is a problem in America? Britney: No. Like I said before, it’s not a problem! [Frustrated with me, looking around uncomfortably]

The use of "teasing" or jokes about race is further investigated by Douglas et al. (2016) 

* Argue that humorous stereotypes of others 

## Conclusion

Diversifying schools are more important than curricula when students mainly map curricula to ideological frames.

* See peer networks and whether this is supported?



**how do white adolescents interpret their the racial context of high school (primarily public)?**

## Introduction

In the __ years since the landmark Supreme Court case *Brown v. Board of Education*, the United States has slowly reverted back to a system of segregated schooling.

* Include statistics, as well as citations of studies that discuss this phenomenon and the extent to which this is true.

The shift back towards a "color-neutral" school assignment policy towards neighborhood specific ones can be attributed to a number of forces, from legislation to , and to the topic of this study: white parents.

- Many of these agents, despite their multitude and complexities, however, adhere to the post-Civil Rights era racial ideology of color-evasive racism (include note of how it was called "color-blind racism" initially, but I will call it color-evasive for the paper for x reasons), which attempts to "racial inequality as the outcome of racial dynamics." In the case of white parents, analysts have discussed how white parents have resisted legislation and policies that would redistribute schooling resources.

However, more recently their arguments against these policies have adopted non-racial language and other subtleties that disguise efforts to reproduce advantages for white children.  

* Language like "good" versus "bad" schools and "well-behaved and intelligent" children versus "lazy and disruptive" ones have become many white parents' racial grammar that simultaneously allows them to reproduce educational advantages for their children without running the risk of appearing "racist."
* These parents, acutely aware of the racial order that frowns upon overt racism, are thus not likely to think that their ideology is being transmitted to their children.

Question: In this article, I ask how white adolescents perceive racialized contexts surrounding public school choices and outline how these efforts can be studied.

* These include non-verbal contexts [**what is the language on this?**] as well as verbal ones. Ex: Bader's (2019) "Talk on the playground"
* Why does this matter? Early empirical evidence (Hagerman 2020) suggests that young people's views on race crystallize throughout their adolescence and that peers, teachers, and school policies impact the racial views of high school-aged students.
  * As opposed to parents in early and middle childhood where parents taking a leading role.

* This paper does no argue that the racial and ethnic socialization (RES) of white adolescents occurs the same for each individual. Previous studies have shown (Grossman 2009) that the white adolescents' views on race vary vastly, from color-conscious claims through diversity ideology to color-evasive ones.
  * But color-evasive ideology is the dominant one (cite Bonilla-Silva)
  * Other demographic variation, such as their parents' degree of education, neighborhoods, socioeconomic status, and region also play a roles.

* A second point about this paper is that it does not simply discuss the white adolescents' *racial attitudes*, such as their feelings about people of color or other measures of racial resentment, but *racial* *ideology*, the "collective manifested" understandings of race that can either reinforce (dominant racial groups) and contest (subordinate racial groups) racial order.

**Map paragraph:**

In this article, I begin with a brief review of racial and ethnic socialization during whites' adolescence. I then analyze existing literature about to discuss how  white adolescents' perceptions of their schools can influence the development of their racial ideologies. The paper concludes by ___

For ==many white parents, the place that they send their children to school is a very serious matter, determining the .==

## Racial and Ethnic Socialization and Racial Ideology

Define both terms and why they are connected.

Early explorations of racial socialization focused primarily on Black children and the ways by which parents prepared them to construct a positive self-identity and face experiences of discrimination and prejudice (list the other ones after reviewing literature).

Whiteness studies

* Even though most white people do not think of themselves as 'raced' people, they are still racialized subjects. Whites are also racialized subjects by virtue of receiving a disproportionate amount of resources in our society
* This means that they are acclimated to the racialized social structure through their interpretations of the actions and words of various forces, such as the media, teachers (Picower 2009), their peers, and their parents.
* Early childhood ethnic socialization.

### Adolescents

As early as ___ age, children develop attitudes and perceptions of race (Gaither and Loyd 2018).

* However, adolescents have more complicated and easily-interpretable ideas about race and racism that solidify throughout teenage and early twenties (cite Hagerman). Thus, it is easier to analyze their racial ideology and understand the transition between childhood and adulthood.
